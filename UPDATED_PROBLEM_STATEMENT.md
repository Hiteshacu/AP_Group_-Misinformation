Track 3: Misinformation 
 Problem Statement 2: Bring our Own Problem

The Problem We're Solving
In today's digital age, misinformation spreads rapidly through encrypted messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. Users are bombarded with forwarded messages containing fake news, phishing scams, and propaganda—often with hidden agendas embedded in images (steganography). Most users lack the tools to verify what's real in real-time, leading to panic, financial losses, and poor decision-making. Existing fact-checkers are reactive and require manual effort, which most users won't do.

Our Solution
An Agentic AI Misinformation Detective that lives on your device, proactively monitoring messages in real-time and alerting you *before* you fall victim to fake news or scams. It combines a unique **Dual-AI Racing Architecture** for speed with advanced **On-Device Steganography Detection**.

How It Works

1)Continuous Monitoring:
- Runs silently in the background using Android's Notification Listener and Accessibility Services
- Watches incoming messages on WhatsApp, WhatsApp Business, and Telegram without manual input
- Operates completely autonomously—no copying or pasting required

2)Multi-Layer Detection:
- **Dual-AI Racing:** Simultaneously queries **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** and **Groq (Llama 3.1)**, using the fastest response (sub-second latency) for instant verification
- **Steganography Detection:** A 3-layer on-device engine (Metadata, Chi-Square, LSB Analysis) scans images for hidden malicious data and propaganda
- **Context-Aware Filtering:** Distinguishes between "High Severity" threats (phishing, health hoaxes) and harmless humor/sarcasm to prevent false alarms

3)Instant Alerts:
- When a threat is detected, a **Red Warning Badge** is overlaid directly on the chat interface
- Users can tap the badge to see a detailed "Fact Check Report" explaining *why* the content is false (e.g., "This contains typical loan scam language")

4)Contextual Intelligence:
- Learns to identify emerging misinformation trends while ignoring harmless memes
- Provides educational tips to help users spot future scams themselves

Key Features

-  **Dual-AI Speed:** Unique "Racing" architecture ensures instant verification by leveraging the fastest available AI model
-  **Steganography Defense:** Rare capability to detect hidden propaganda and malicious data inside images using statistical analysis
-  **Zero Effort Required:** Fully autonomous agent—works as an overlay on top of your existing chat apps
-  **Privacy-First:** Steganography analysis happens entirely on-device; smart filtering ensures only necessary text is analyzed
-  **Smart Severity Grading:** Distinguishes between critical threats (Red Alert) and harmless jokes

Why It Matters

- During Elections: Stops political propaganda and fake news from influencing voters via private channels
- During Health Crises: Prevents dangerous medical misinformation (e.g., fake cures) from spreading
- Everyday Safety: Protects users from financial scams disguised as legitimate offers
- For Everyone: Designed for everyday citizens, especially the elderly and less tech-savvy who are most vulnerable

What Makes Us Different
Most fact-checking tools are **reactive** (you have to ask them). We are **proactive**. Most tools check text. We check **hidden image data (Steganography)**. Most tools are slow. We use **Dual-AI Racing** to achieve real-time speed.

Impact:
By empowering users with an intelligent agent that works 24/7, we reduce the spread of misinformation at the source—the individual level. When people stop sharing fake content because they were warned in time, the entire information ecosystem becomes healthier.

Our Vision: A world where everyone has a personal AI guardian protecting them from the flood of misinformation, making digital communication safe again.
